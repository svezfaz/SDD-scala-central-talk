              HomeAway is on a quest to assert their presence as a key player in the vacation rentals market.
              And it's doing it by investing in digital marketing. What we are specifically interested in, is
              digital marketing automation.
              The end goals are two:
              the first is automating repetitive actions traditionally performed by humans in the digital marketing sphere.
              The second is to move forward and gain an edge over human activity by minimizing errors and reaction times

            1. the problem

            2. the framework

            Note:
            So the agenda is extremely simple,
            First we’ll take a look at the problem we are facing
            Then we'll see how reactive streams are a good fit for this problem
            and finally we’ll look at the framework we’ve built to solve it - with the help of some sample code.

            So let’s get started.

              ###DYNAMIC ADS
              ![dynamic ad](asset/dynamic_ad.png)

              Note:
              To make our advertisements more effective, we want them to be dynamic,
              that is, show relevant content to the relevant people at the relevant time.

              Let's assume someone already was on HomeAway.com and was looking at this property, but didn't
              book it. It could be a good target for an ad like this to try and bring him or her back to the site.

              The key point here is that whoever displays this ads needs to be up to date with our data,
              and this data can change a lot. For example the price of a property can fluctuate a lot.
              So we need to get our data to the ad platforms, and we need to get it there fast.

              This operation of sending product data to platforms is traditionally done manually by marketers,
              sending a big fat Excel file to an email address and hoping no one on the other side is on holiday.

              Our objective is to make this programmatic. Essentially we want to set up automated data feeds

              First of all there are multiple platforms that we want to reach.
              These you can see are only a few of them. They want different data,
              with different presentation and they support different integrations.

              Secondly, the information we need to send is scattered in many places within HomeAway
              we got a variety of sources we need to integrate, and they come in different forms,

              Note:
              This is a perfect use case for designing a reactive system. These you see are the traits of a reactive system, taken from the reactive manifesto.
              Although we are not trying to build a responsive system in the traditional sense, as we are building a backend-to-backend integration,
              we want it to be elastic (...) and resilient (...), and therefore, we want it to be fully asynchronous and message driven.

              We'll start by reasoning about the reactive layer, so we're going "middle-out" in terms of design.

              this layer makes the only opinionated choice in using Akka Streams.
              this layer responsibility is to use akka streams to define the stages of the pipeline

              The whole reactive layer is based on the concept of stage.
              A stage is a reactive component of arbitrary complexity.
              It is reusable and composable.

              They come in form of sources, sinks, flows, graphs depending on the shape they have,
              that is, the number of input and output ports they have.

              It's important to note that, to us, these are not just Akka Streams DSL objects,
              but they became part of the ubiquitous language. In other words, they became the official glossary
              used within the team.

              1. shape (strongly typed in/out ports)
              2. materialized value (last type param)

              Note:
              An Akka stage has an external blueprint made up of its shape, which is essentially a bunch of
              strongly typed input and output ports, and its materialized value, which can be seen as the stage
              interface, or a way to interact with the stage.

              We found it is good practice to make these types a product of the analysis phase
              of your user story, and then let them drive your testing and your implementation.
              So let's design our stages.

              Note:
              We are going to need a source of properties, so we can design a source with output type Property.
              And our materialized value will be a Shutdownable, i.e. something we can call shutdown on, to be
              able to control our kafka stream.

              Note:
              Then we'll have a flow (1 input, 1 output) to perform the validation logic.
              Property is our input, and as output we can use Cats validated, i.e.
              something that can be invalid, i.e. a validation error, or valid, i.e. a property
              This is not the only way you can model this, just wanted to mention we like to use Cats
              types at this level to increase expressiveness.

              We'll need one sink for properties, and one for errors.
              Treat errors as messages is prescribed by the reactive manifesto, and allows you to handle errors all in one place.

              Note:
              Now that we have defined the stage types, we can proceed to testing and implementation.

              This is a good moment to look around for any library which might already offer what we need.
              I've listed some of them on this slide. For example if you need a source reading from Kafka..

              ...it's a good idea to use ReactiveKafka. This is a stable library that can give you
              sources and sinks to interact with Kafka. In this example you can see you can easily
              get a Kafka source by providing a bunch of settings - note that you'll need to provide
              a deserializer. However, this source is typed with reactive-kafka types. You see it is
              a source of consumerRecord that materialized to a Control.
              It is good practice to not leak these types outside of the stage, and this is what you
              can see in the second part of the source...

              The property sink is equally simple, as it wraps another domain entity, which is a property repository.
              The difference here is that this repository will talk to Google Adwords, hence it will
              provide and async behaviour. Using the mapAsync combinator we can limit the number of parallel calls
              we'll make.

              The graph is where everything comes together. Akka Streams graphDSL allows to define
              your topology in a very visual way.

              Using GraphDSL might seem verbose as it carries some boilerplate - and for this example is definitely overkill.
              However, the graphDSL will reflect the topology of your pipeline while it grows.
              It is self documenting code, which is awesome.

              You can clearly see how the graph resembles the graph we initially designed on paper.

              The stuff we have in here has been driven by the decisions we have made on the reactive layer.
              We need entities representing a Property, and a validation error, which we can now model,
              we need a service to validate, and we need a repository to deal with the AdWords API.

              Note:
              Using reactive streams we squeeze our local environments by minimizing resource contention
              (by virtue of asynchronous non-blocking processing)
              Whenever this is not sufficient, we can easily scale horizontally thanks to Kafka and Docker.
