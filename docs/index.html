              HomeAway is on a quest to assert their presence as a key player in the vacation rentals market.
              And it's doing it by investing in digital marketing. What we are specifically interested in, is
              digital marketing automation.
              The end goals are two:
              the first is automating repetitive actions traditionally performed by humans in the digital marketing sphere.
              The second is to move forward and gain an edge over human activity by minimizing errors and reaction times

            1. the problem
            3. the (reactive) approach
            2. the framework

            Note:
            So the agenda is extremely simple,
            First we’ll take a look at the problem we are facing
            Then we'll see how reactive streams are a good fit for this problem
            and finally we’ll look at the framework we’ve built to solve it - with the help of some sample code.

            So let’s get started.

              ![alt text](asset/dynamic_ad.png "Dynamic Ad")

              Note:
              The problem is the following. To make our advertisements more effective,
              we want them to be dynamic - that is, show relevant content to the relevant people at the relevant time.

              Let's assume someone looked for flights to Cape Town, it could be a good target to show an ad like this.
              This is what's called prospecting, that is, looking for new clients.

              Or it could be that someone already was on HomeAway website and was looking at this property, but didn't
              book it. It could be a good target for an ad like this to try and bring him back to the site.

              ![alt text](asset/ad_platforms.svg "Ad platforms")

              Note:
              There is a variety of platforms out there offering dynamic ads. Google adwords, Facebook and others.

              These platforms are notified by HomeAway whenever a user interacts with our website.
              The same happens for many other sites. These platforms have their own algorithms to determine
              what's the most relevant ad to show, plus there is usually a real-time bid going on between
              whoever might want to display an ad.

              ![alt text](asset/dynamic_ad.png "Dynamic Ad")

              Note:
              Let’s just assume Facebook shows a specific holiday home to a potential customer.
              we want the details of this property to be spot on and up to date - best example is the price of a property, which might change greatly.
              We want it to reflect the current price of the property to hope that the customer would buy - or convert in marketing lingo.

              The key here is to keep these advertisers up to date with our data - our properties, our destinations, etc.

              This operation of sending product data to advertisers is traditionally done manually by marketers sending a big fat Excel file to an email address and hoping no one on the other side is on holiday.

              Note:
              Our objective is to make this programmatic. Essentially we want to set up automated data feeds
              from us to these platforms. There are several variables to this problem:
              - different input data (product, destinations, audiences)
              - different data sources (kafka, http, ...)
              - different data validation
              - different data presentation
              - different data sinks (http, SFTP, S3)

              ![alt text](asset/reactive-traits.svg "Reactive Streams")

              Note:
              Reactive streams make for a perfect use case in this scenario, as they allow for robust, fault-tolerant solutions whenever an infinite stream of data needs to be handled.

              This is why we went ahead and decide to structure our system as a bunch of loosely connected reactive pipelines.
              We decided to solve the approach by developing a bunch of self-contained services - or streams. Each and every stream has the task of reading from a datasource, transform the data according to a specific advertisers format, and publish the data.

              (One might argue this solution is not efficient if the sources and sinks are proliferating..etc.etc)

              Note:
              Why Akka Streams?

              This is the only opinionated choice that our framework does.

              (Why not Apache Flink?
              That is what  distinguishes those systems from libraries such as Akka Streams, RxJava, or Vert.x.
              The presented frameworks are mainly located in the Big and Fast Data area, while the libraries can also be
              used to build smaller, more reactive applications, but usually without native support for event time and
              clustering.)

              Testing a graph is way simpler than testing a side-effecting application.
              We can be more thorough with testing on the reactive layer as it's cheaper and quicker.

              Creating a graph forces you to reason about 2 things:
              1) the topology of your pipeline
              2) the types of your stages

              Using GraphDSL might seem verbose as it carries some boilerplate - and for this example is definitely overkill.
              However, the graphDSL will reflect the topology of your pipeline while it grows.
              It is self documenting code, which is awesome.

              This is where everything comes together. The graph can accomodate non-functional stages for logging,
              monitoring, error handling...

              application layer: lifecycle and configuration
              reactive layer: all the reactive infrastructure (with the help of Akka)
              domain layer: all things business logic

            ###METHODOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS
            - start with a dummy pipeline and bring it to prod
            - iterate adding/changing AT MOST ONE stage per iteration

            #KEY TAKEAWAYS
            1. Borrow from Akka Streams to extend your ubiquitous language
            2. Brainstorm on the stages types before coding
            3. Browse for off-the-shelf stages
            4. Separate your reactive infrastructure from your domain
